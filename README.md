## This project is the capston project for Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree. 
I used Google Map Api and Google Place Api to get location and place details. 
Users can get lists of nearby hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, parks..., and they also can get more details information of a place they interesting, and directions of how to get there. And users also can search places by entering the place names. 
The app also allow users to save their favourite place and view offline.
